                <p class="river_text">The White Salmon River is a popular getaway spot year-round, although the season usually stays steady from March to November1. Early season, when flows are the highest, is the best time to come if you are looking for a wild ride. By August, after the peak runoff, the river mellows (just a bit) to still-fun, but wider-spaced rapids2. The seasonal window of spring runoff is a spectacular moment in the annual cycle of any free-flowing river and makes it the best time to raft the Salmon River3. Winter and spring are the seasons for the Middle Fork of the Salmon River4.</p>
