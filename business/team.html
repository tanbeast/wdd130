        <h3>Meet the team<br>
            Our group of friends has always enjoyed working on crafty projects. Danny and Kade have both done booths at the local renaissance fair and we all liked the idea of selling some of our projects. We are hoping to work together to make more unique merchandise.

                I am the one that invited all my friends to join me in selling our projects and enjoy building things together. Some of my favorite projects are woodwork. John and I usually work together on things like tables, chairs, ect..
                For my smaller projects I like to do cutting boards, clocks, and some origami.

                Mostly with some dice for my D&D games I was able to sell a few sets to other players
                I am starting to do some bigger projects like tables and I have a few other ideas about some new things to try.

                I am the oldest of the group and plan to join the military in a few years.
                I enjoy doing leatherwork and have sold some at one of the renaissance fairs I have been to and I thought it was a great way of doing the things that I like to do
